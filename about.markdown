Hey, I’m Ramjan.  

I’m a computer science student at VIT Chennai, working my way through AI, robotics, and the messy beauty of programming. Most of my time goes into building things for the web - sometimes they work smoothly, sometimes they break in ways that teach me more than tutorials ever could.  

I enjoy tinkering with React, Next.js, databases, and occasionally going down rabbit holes with machine learning and Linux.  

Outside of code, I play guitar, write when I can, and keep a curious eye on how people think and behave. Those things keep me grounded when the tech side of life gets too loud.  

You can find my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/ravenZ3),  
or just drop me a message at **ramjankhandelwal7@gmail.com**.
