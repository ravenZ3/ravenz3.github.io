Two soldiers walked through the morning meadow, unaware they had entered a minefield. 

One of them was more like a protégé carrying the map, and the other was a major. They were tasked to carry supplies between two infantry units.

The major was feeling complacent that day, the sky blue and air pleasant on his face as they walked through the meadows. He spent the time talking about his siblings and friends and the fields back home, how the paddy fields dance in the wind in august. The ground was sodden yet leaf-covered, autumn's carpet collecting beneath their boots.

But something happened. 
They heard a metallic click. Something the protégé had stepped on.
Their hearts skipped a beat and shivers burned down their spines. Time stopped. There was a moment of perfect quiet. 

But nothing had happened.
The protégé had stepped on a mine. A dud mine.
Thank God.
They sat down to calm their nerves and breathe grateful breaths. They were alive. Miraculously, impossibly alive.

They decided not to talk about this, and they did not. They then found a different route and walked carefully to the infantry unit, wrapped in the surreal quietness of what could have been. The weight of almost-death hung between them like morning fog.

But we know what actually happened that fateful day.
There were two lessons learned. They didn't share their epiphanies with each other - both decided to keep their realizations close to their chests as guilt filled their hearts.

The major learned that he shouldn't have been so careless on a mission. He could have cost his life and his protégé's, and all the people who could have been indirectly hurt by his negligence.

The protégé learned that he shouldn't have been holding the map upside down.
