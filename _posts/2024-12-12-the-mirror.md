Tired from the work and the people I swing open the door to my attic, that hides itself in the far corners of the hanging gardens of my mind. It stands cloaked in the rotting veins of Wisteria. The air is heavy and stale – difficult to breathe in at times. But the coziness redeems the toxicity like the liquor redeems the headaches it leaves in its wake.

Confiding in people like I did, in the ones that I had known, whom I had taken to be my own has now inevitably disparaged my own soul.

There’s a room in disarray: drawers rifled through, a wardrobe ransacked, ink spilled across a letter that sits on the dusty desk that never knew no writers, only cryptic symbols scrawled in a language it would take a lifetime to decipher.

Then I see them – the bloody footprints, smeared all across the wall and the floor.

But how did they get there ? No trail leads coming in and going out the porch.

I crouch down, comparing them to my own, and my stomach churns. They resemble my own feet.

I do not recall having stepped over a betrayed soldier's path. Yet those footprints linger, as if to say that betrayal and I are not as distant as I would have myself believe.
Something presses against my face- heavy, suffocating. My fingers trace its shape, and the truth of it dawns on me.

A gas mask. Torn, battered, greasy, . . warm? like the kind the SS guards used to wear in the harrowing halls of Auschwitz. The thought creeps in before I can think of another, convulsing in my mind. How did it get here? No answer comes, only the cold certainty that it is.
My mind writhes like a squashed centipede. I don't feel the pain, for now.

It feels heavy on my face. The back of the ears numb from the weight of it. I don't recall ever putting it on. In a frazzled moment of caprice, I claw at it, desperate to tear it off.

Removing it gnaws at me. The mask falls away, and a sharp scent of metal and rust spikes the air-jarring against the lush meadow before me. The field seems so alive, yet the smell clings to my senses like a warning, something lurking hiding beneath the surface of this flowery meadow.

There is silence over here but I can't shake the feeling the winds carry with them screams and cries like the walls of this place have seen something unkind.

Silence, not the peaceful kind, but the kind that looms in the cursed mansions and the cruel asylums after they've had silenced their Luther Kings.

Something is not right here. And my eyes can't see it.
