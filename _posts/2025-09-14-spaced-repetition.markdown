There is a exact time when you should revise a concept after you've learned it, and doing it at the certain duration your brain is about to forget the information ensures that you your recall probability is increased for a longer forgetting gap interval which follows your revision.

I was trying to figure out the right time that I should revise the dsa algos that I've been learning to commit them to memory. Which led me to this:

*This is a comprehensive case study from the foundational papers to the state of the art algorithms that comprise spaced repetition.*

## The foundational papers
### Ebbinghaus, H (1885) - *Memory: A contribution to Experimental Psychology*
Ebbinghaus describes the memory as the presistence of mental states (sensations, feelings , ideas) which were at one time present in the conciousness and then had disappeared from it and in the disappearing, "have not absolutely ceased to exist".
These states are stored and revaled through various effects, even if not directly observable.

- Voluntary Recollection: We can call back our conciousness by an excertion of the will to the seemingly lost states.
That is a willful recall of past states or their images. During recollecion, irrevelant images may appear but the target is recognized as previously experienced.
The will "*discovers*" rather than creates.

- Involuntary Reproduction: Mental states return spontaneously, often after years without effort. We usually recognize them as memories. Even if recognition is absent, the familiarity confirms thier prior existence. These reproductions follow "laws of association", triggered bu the current mental images.

- Facilitation Effects: Even without direct recall, sometimes the occurance of certain conditions facilitates the occurance of certain thought processes which are similar to one that we had experienced before, even though we can not recollect what and may not have experienced the specific condition before. Long story short - pattern recognition. **But there is more to it than just that**. 
> A certain range of thought facilitates under certain conditions the employment of a similar range of thought,even if former does not comeb before the mind directly in any form.

#### Memory in its dependence
memory's strength (retention and retrieval) depends on various factors like -
1. individual differences: people vary in retention abilites and the same person changes across times (morning vs evening, youth vs old age)
2. content differences: melodies and tunes stuck more stubbornly and easily than forms/colors. emotions are hard to vividly (which is a good thing.) and often require associated movements. Poetry, music and numbers stick differently based on individual participation.
3. attention and interest: Intense focus or interest strenghtens memory
(e.g. a single vivid experience like a burn or beatin creates lasting avoidance ). Casual encounter like the color of someone's eye or the the glasses they were wearing tend to slip from one's memory.
4. Repetitons: Multiple exposures are needed for mastery of complex material like algos and poems. Addtional repetions build assurance.
5. Time and decay: Retention weakens over time without review; even deeply rooted knowledge can fade away after disuse. (He describes mother tounge, though I'm skeptical about this.)

#### What Ebbinghaus did:

 Though I would call it a pioneer in scientific inquiry.
 He made 2,300 nonsense consonant combinations like "ZOF" and "WID", and made lists from it each containing about 12-36 vowels.
 He memorised then by reading them aloud at a fixed rhythm. He tested his retention and after intervals (from minutes to days or weeks). He relearned the same list to same criterion and monitored the conditions like time of day and fatigue, and distractions to ensure reliablity.
I'll come back this later.
